# Learning Topic: Simulation

## Concept of Simulation
Simulation is a technique used to model the behavior of a system using a computer program. It allows us to study and analyze the performance of a system without having to experiment with the real system.

## Example: Coin Toss Simulation
- A fair coin has an equal probability of landing on heads or tails, which is 0.5.
- By simulating multiple coin tosses, we can estimate the probability of getting heads.
- This involves using random number generation to mimic the randomness of a real coin toss.

## Theoretical Concepts
- **Probability:** The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
- **Randomness:** The lack of pattern or predictability in events.
- **Law of Large Numbers:** As the number of trials increases, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability.
