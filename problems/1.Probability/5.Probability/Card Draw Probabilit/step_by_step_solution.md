# Step-by-Step Solution for Card Draw Probability

## Approach
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate drawing a card from a standard 52-card deck `n` times.
   - We need to calculate the probability of drawing an Ace.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - Initialize a counter for Aces.
   - Loop `n` times to simulate each card draw.
   - Use `random.choice` to simulate drawing a card from the deck.
   - If the result is an Ace, increment the counter.
   - After the loop, calculate the probability by dividing the Ace count by `n`.

3. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Write the code to perform the above steps.

## Practical Example
- If we draw a card 52 times, we expect around 4 draws to be an Ace.
- By simulating this process, we can estimate the probability of drawing an Ace.
