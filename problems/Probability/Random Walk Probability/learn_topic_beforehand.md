# Learning Topic: Simulation

## Concept of Simulation
Simulation is a technique used to model the behavior of a system using a computer program. It allows us to study and analyze the performance of a system without having to experiment with the real system.

## Example: Random Walk Simulation
- A random walk is a mathematical model that describes a path consisting of a sequence of random steps.
- In a 2D grid, each step can be in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right.
- By simulating multiple random walks, we can estimate the probability of the walker being at the origin after `n` steps.

## Theoretical Concepts
- **Probability:** The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
- **Randomness:** The lack of pattern or predictability in events.
- **Law of Large Numbers:** As the number of trials increases, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability.
